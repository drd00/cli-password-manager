# drd00's CLI Password Manager
I am terrible at naming things. This aims to be a fast and minimal password manager written in C.

Cryptographic functions are provided by **libsodium**. The rest of program aims to provide a user interface, handling memory for secure password management.
That said, this is my first project using C (I had a lot of fun!), so I would **not** recommend this be used in its current unaudited state --- I am not a cybersecurity expert.
